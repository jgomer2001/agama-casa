### About Casa project

This project implements the authentication experience featured by the Jans-Casa component of Janssen Server. 

#### Deployment
This project is automatically deployed when Casa is installed (or added post-install). Do not deploy this manually.

#### Configuration
There is no need to supply configurations for this project because it is automatically configured upon deployment. However, you may like to glance at the default settings and change anything you consider relevant using a tool such as [TUI](https://docs.jans.io/v1.1.5/admin/config-guide/auth-server-config/agama-project-configuration/#using-text-based-ui).

#### Test
In a browser, open `https://<hostname>/jans-casa`. Go through the casa [docs](https://docs.jans.io/head/casa/) to learn how to configure authentication.

#### Customization
This aspect is covered in the developer doc [page](https://docs.jans.io/head/casa/developer/overview/#customizing-the-authentication-flow).
